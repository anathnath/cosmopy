CosmoCalc
=========

Program to rapidly calculate cosmological parameters for a given epoch.

Currently, the user provides a redshift and the program returns the full set of
cosmological parameters, based on interpolating between a pre-created table of
values.


Changes
-------
2013-10-16 - Program checks for integration table, if it doesn't exist - prompt's user whether or
             or not to create one with the default settings.  If yes, builds; otherwise exits.
             Table filename has also been made a hidden file, and is placed in the script's dir.


To-Do
-----
[1] - Provide any parameter (e.g. luminosity distance) and recieve all
      cosmological parameters.
[3] - CMB Temperature

2013-10-16 - [2] - Behavior if no integration-table file already exists (i.e. for first run)
