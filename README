CosmoCalc
=========

Program to rapidly calculate cosmological parameters for a given epoch.

Currently, the user provides a redshift and the program returns the full set of
cosmological parameters, based on interpolating between a pre-created table of
values.



To-Do
-----
[1] - Provide any parameter (e.g. luminosity distance) and recieve all
      cosmological parameters.
[2] - Behavior if no integration-table file already exists (i.e. for first run)
